# Gemini Shift Enter Blocker Extension

## üß© About This Extension

The **Gemini Shift Enter Blocker** is a lightweight Chrome extension designed to improve the user experience when typing prompts into [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app).

- Pressing **Enter** adds a new line.
- Pressing **Shift + Enter** adds a new line.
- Mouse click to submits the prompt.
- Enable/Disable the feature by toggling on/off via the popup.

It also includes a toggle in the extension popup, allowing you to quickly enable or disable the functionality as needed.

### ‚úÖ Ideal for:
- Users who frequently write multi-line prompts
- Power users looking for more control over Gemini input
- Anyone frustrated by accidental prompt submissions while writing
